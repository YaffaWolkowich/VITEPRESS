# ðŸ¥‡ Best Practices & Conventions

A set of standards and guidelines that are used to create consistent, maintainable,
secure, and high-quality code, while improving productivity and maximizing
the value of investments.

They are standards, rules, techniques, and best practices to develop cleaner,
more readable, and more efficient code with minimal errors. They offer a uniform
format for software engineers to build sophisticated and highly functional code.

Conventions can change and evolve over time, it is important to stay current.
